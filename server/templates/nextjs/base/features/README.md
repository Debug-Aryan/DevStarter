# DevStarter blueprints (internal)

The folders inside `features/` are **DevStarter internal feature blueprints**.

- They are **not meant to be run directly** in this Next.js app.
- DevStarter uses them for **feature injection / code generation** when you create projects.

If you’re building your product, your runtime code should live in `app/`, `components/`, and `lib/`.
