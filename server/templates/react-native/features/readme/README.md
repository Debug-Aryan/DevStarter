# __PROJECT_NAME__ (React Native + Expo)

This project was generated by **DevStarter** using the **React Native (Expo)** stack.

Expo helps you build iOS and Android apps with React Native *without* needing to set up native build tools just to start developing.

---

## What’s included

- React Native app managed by Expo (JavaScript)
- Navigation via React Navigation (auth flow + app flow)
- JWT auth using Context API
- Token persistence using AsyncStorage
- Centralized API layer with automatic `Authorization` header support
- Utility-first styling using **NativeWind** (Tailwind-style `className`)

---

## Folder structure

All app code lives in `src/`:

- `src/App.js` – **only app entry (app composition)**
- `src/components/PrimaryButton.js` – reusable styled button
- `src/config/env.js` – environment configuration
- `src/context/AuthContext.js` – auth state + persistence (AsyncStorage)
- `src/navigation/RootNavigator.js` – auth stack vs app stack routing
- `src/screens/` – UI screens
  - `HomeScreen.js`
  - `LoginScreen.js`
  - `RegisterScreen.js`
- `src/services/api.js` – axios wrapper + auth token injection

Root config files:

- `app.json`
- `babel.config.js`
- `package.json`
- `tailwind.config.js`

Note: Expo’s default entry expects an `App` file at the project root. This template keeps app logic in `src/App.js` and uses a tiny `App.jsx` shim to satisfy Expo’s resolver.

---

## NativeWind (Tailwind) setup

NativeWind is already configured for you:

- `nativewind` is installed
- `tailwind.config.js` is present
- `babel.config.js` includes:

```js
module.exports = {
  presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
  plugins: ['nativewind/babel'],
};
```

Use `className` in components, for example:

```js
<View className="flex-1 items-center justify-center bg-white" />
```

---

## Auth flow (JWT)

This starter uses a standard JWT flow:

1. Login (`/auth/login`) or Register (`/auth/register`)
2. Backend returns `{ token: "<jwt>" }`
3. Token is stored in AsyncStorage
4. API client automatically sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
5. Logout clears the token and returns you to the auth screens

---

## Environment configuration (API base URL)

The API base URL is read from `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` (see `src/config/env.js`).

### Development

Set the variable before starting Expo.

PowerShell:

- `$env:EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL = "http://<your-ip>:3000"`

Bash:

- `export EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL="http://<your-ip>:3000"`

If you’re testing on a real phone: **don’t use `localhost`** (on the phone, localhost points to the phone). Use your computer’s LAN IP.

### Production

Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` in your build environment (EAS). Never ship secrets in mobile apps.

---

## Run locally

1. Install dependencies:

- `npm install`

Windows PowerShell note (execution policy):

- `npm.cmd install`

2. Start Expo:

- `npx expo start`

PowerShell alternative:

- `npx.cmd expo start`

---

## Android / iOS notes

- Expo Go is the fastest way to test on-device
- Android emulator: Android Studio helps, but isn’t required to start
- iOS simulator requires macOS + Xcode
- For production builds, use EAS Build

---

## DevStarter features (important)

In the DevStarter generator templates, `react-native/features/` contains **feature blueprints**.

- They are **not runnable apps**
- DevStarter injects selected features into the runnable base template at `react-native/base/client`
